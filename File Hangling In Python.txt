# Opening a File :

"""
   
Before we can perform any operations on a file, we must 
first open it. Python provides the open() function to open 
a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and 
the mode in which the file should be opened.

"""

# Modes in file

"""

There are various modes in which we can open files.

1. read (r): This mode opens the file for reading only 
   and gives an error if the file does not exist. This is 
   the default mode if no mode is passed as a parameter.

2. write (w): This mode opens the file for writing only
   and creates a new file if the file does not exist. This
   mode ovwewrites the previous text in the file if the
   program is run again with the new text. In this case the 
   new text will overwrier the previous one in the file.

3. append (a): This mode opens the file for appending only 
   and creates a new file if the file does not exist. Adds
   new data to the existing data.

4. create (x): This mode creates a file and gives an error
   if the file already exists.So it might be useful during
   if we want it in error handling. Otherwise the write()
   modes creates it.

5. text (t): Apart from these modes we also need to specify
   how the file must be handled. t mode is used to handle 
   text files. t refers to the text mode. There is no 
   difference between r and rt or w and wt since text mode
   is the default. The default mode is 'r' 
   (open for reading text, synonym of 'rt' ).

6. binary (b): used to handle binary files (images, 
   pdfs etc).

# Writing Something As a Text To a File :
    
"""

f = open("D://File1.txt", "wt")

f.write("My name iz Haroon."
        "\n\nI am learning cybersecuritry")

f.close()

# Reading a file in Binary Form (Image) :

"""

f1 = open("D://Kernel Auditing Linux.jpg", "rb")

pic = f1.read()
print(pic)

f1.close()

"""

# Reading a file as a text (Text) :

"""




f1 = open("D://File1.txt", "rt")

txt = f1.read()
print(txt)

f1.close()

# Reading a PDF File : 
    
"""

f = open("D://python.pdf", "rb")

f.write(b"Hi My age is 20.\nI am an Idiot.")

f.close()

"""

# Appending Data to a File :

"""
(t) and (b) can also be used here, just mentioning (b) 
before binary data is mandatory coz (t) is default


f = open("D://File3.txt", "a")

f.write("\nI am an Idiot. \nI am Stupid. ")

f.close()

"""

# Closing a File :
    
"""

It is important to close a file after you are done with 
it.To close a file, you can use the close() method as used
above

"""

# The 'with' statement :
    
"""

Alternatively, you can use the with statement to 
automatically close the file after you are done with it.

with open("File3.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
